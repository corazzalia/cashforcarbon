# I. Introduction

Deforestation is responsible for the equivalent of 11.3% of global CO2 emissions, making it one of the biggest contributors to global warming. Indeed, when a tree is cut down, it stops absorbing CO2 and, by decomposing or burning, its carbon stock is released into the atmosphere. 
Fighting against this phenomenon can then turn out to be particularly profitable insofar as it allows both to significantly reduce global warming, while protecting from serious consequences on the ecosystems then attacked. 
Deforestation is most widespread in developing countries. The wood is exported or used as fuel, while the deforested land is used for agricultural crops. That's why Seema Jayachandran, an economist at Northwestern University, conducted the Cash for Carbon experiment between 2011 and 2013 with the help of Joost de Laat, a poverty specialist at the Dutch NGO Porticus. 
This randomized controlled trial conducted in Uganda, then one of the countries with the highest deforestation rate in the world, aimed to finance some Ugandan forest owners in exchange for the conservation of their trees. After two years, all they had to do was to assess the difference in tree cover between the control and treatment groups and measure the gain from this conservation through the social cost of carbon, an indicator of the monetary value of carbon. 
In 2013, at the end of the experiment, the researchers found that the tree cover of the control group had decreased by 9.1%, twice as much as the treatment group. The benefits of the experiment were thus 2.4 times higher than its cost, which made this operation a real success in the fight against global warming.
The objective of our approach will be to replicate this experiment with the help of the data provided by the researchers and to evaluate the consistency of our results with theirs.

## Loading packages and data

We load the packages : 

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# loading packages
library(tidyverse) # manipulating and viewing data
library(haven) # loading data in stata format
library(knitr) # to create tables
library(kableExtra) # to make aesthetic tables
library(AER)

library(gtsummary)
```

We load the data from the experiment: 

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# opening up of data 
data <- read_dta("C:/Users/liaco/Downloads/PES_analysis_science.dta") %>%
  filter(sample_gps == 1) %>%
  select(-sample_gps)
```

# II. Presentation of the data and variables you use

We have 1099 observations of 130 variable in the data. 
In our study, we will use the following variables:

- hhead_age: gives the age of the head of the household 
- hhead_educ: gives the number of years of education of the head of the household
- ihs_land_area: gives the self-reported area of land held by the head of the household
- forest_area: gives the self-reported area of forest owned by the head of the household  
- any_tree_cut: shows whether the PFO has cut any trees in the last 3 years
- cut_cult: shows whether any trees were cut for the purpose of cultivating the land 
- cut_timber: shows whether trees have been cut for the purpose of producing timber products 
- cut_emerg: shows whether trees have been cut for the purpose of dealing with emergencies such as hospital charges, or major expenses, such as school fees. 
- ihs_tim_price_1yr: IHS of total revenue from cut trees
- rent: shows if the PFO rented part of his land
- disputewith3 : shows if the PFO has ever had disputes with neighbours about the land
- envprog_bi: shows if the owner is already involved in any environmental program
- envprob_9: shows if the PFO agrees that deforestation affects the community 
- opi_hurtenv_agr: shows if the OFP agrees that it is necessary to damage the environment to improve living conditions 
- fcover_change9111_vil: percentage change in vegetation in the village between 1990 and 2010 
- fcover_change9111: percentage change in vegetation in the PFO land circle between 1990 and 2010 
- base_fcover_act: gives the tree cover of the PFO land circle
- perc_forest : gives the percentage of PFO land circle with tree cover
- base_fcover_vil : gives the tree cover of the villages
- perc_forest_vil: gives the percentage of village with tree cover
- Fperc_paid : proportion of eligible amount paid
- Pay_cons : amount paid for avoided deforestation
- Conserved : PFO is enrolled and deemed to have conserve forest 
- num_PFOs_vil : number of PFOs in baseline sample
- inc_pc_vil : average weekly earnings per capita
- dist_road_vil : distance to the nearest main road
- l1_area_vil : average size of the reported land nearest the dwelling
- photo1991_vil : photosynthetic vegetation (ha) in village in 1991 
- photo2011_vil : photosynthetic vegetation (ha) in village in 2011 

Concerning the outcomes, we are interested in the following one : change_fcover_vil which shows the change in the forest area in the village between the beginning and the end of the programme. 

As regards treatment, we are dealing with one-sided non-compliance. We have the variable "treat" which gives us which villages were allocated to the treatment. There is also the variable "Ftakeup" which tells us which PFOs actually attended the programme. 


# III. Data cleaning 

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    # recoding of the treat variable
    treat = case_when(treat == 1 ~ "Treatment",treat == 0 ~ "Control")
    )
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# we rename some variables that are not very readable 
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
  data <- data %>% rename(cut_for_cultivating = cut_cult, cut_for_timber = cut_timber, cut_for_emergency = cut_emerg, 
  ihs_tot_revenue = ihs_tim_price_1yr, hurtenv_agree = opi_hurtenv_agr, fcover_change_90_10_vil = fcover_change9111_vil, 
  fcover_change_90_10 = fcover_change9111)
                
```

IV. Explanation of the treatment allocation process

The study was conducted in 121 villages with private forest owners (PFOs).  60 of these villages were randomly selected to be part of the treatment group. In the villages allocated to the treatment group, the PES programme was marketed to PFOs, who could enrol if they wished. Only 32% of the PFOs in the treatment group villages agreed to participate in the programme. Indeed, 180 PFOs enrolled out of the 564 who were in villages allocated to the treatment group

V. Highlighting the "balance" of the treatment

We try to see if the control and treatment groups are similar 

## Number of PFOs in each group 

Let's see if the number of PFOs in the control group is close to the number of PFOs in the treatment group
```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# we take the data  
data %>%
  # and for each group (treatment or control)
  group_by(treat) %>%
# we count the number of participants which corresponds to the new variable number_obs 
summarise(nombre_obs = n())
```
There are more PFOs in the treatment group and the difference is quite large (29). Indeed, although there are almost the same number of villages in each group, there are not the same number of PFOs in each village. This difference is therefore quite normal.

## Table : summary statistics for each group

To observe the characteristics of the treatment and control groups, one can reproduce "Table 1 : Summary statistics for treatment and control groups" from the researchers' paper. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# cr√©ation de table
summary_table <- data %>%
  select(
    treat,
    hhead_age,
    hhead_educ,
    ihs_land_area,
    forest_area,
    any_tree_cut,
    cut_for_cultivating,
    cut_for_timber,
    cut_for_emergency,
    ihs_tot_revenue,
    rent,
    disputewith3,
    envprog_bi,
    envprob_9,
    hurtenv_agree,
    base_fcover_vil,
    perc_forest_vil,
    fcover_change_90_10_vil,
    base_fcover_act,
    perc_forest,
    fcover_change_90_10
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(treat), names_to = "covariate", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(treat, covariate) %>%
  summarise(mean = round(mean(value, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = treat, values_from = mean)
# affichage de la table
summary_table %>%
  rename(Covariate = covariate) %>%
  kable(., align = c("l", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```
From the table, the two groups seem to have similar characteristics. However, there are small differences in the forest areas at the beginning of the treatment. In fact, the forest areas vary greatly from one OFP to another. Some can have very large areas of forest which can easily change the average of a group. For example, there are small differences in forest area at the beginning of the treatment (22.53ha difference between the two groups for forest area in the village). In fact, the forest areas are very variable from one PFO to another. Some can have very large areas of forest which can easily change the average of a group. 

## Boxplot

Let's try to see more clearly with the help of box plots for some variables. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
#Boxplot for age 
ageplot <- ggplot(data = data) + # boxplot showing the age distribution according to the treatement
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.character(treat), y = hhead_age , color = as.character(treat))) +
  xlab('treat') +
  labs(title = 'Age boxplot') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) #putting the title in the middle
#Boxplot for years of education
educationplot <- ggplot(data = data) + # boxplot showing the age distribution according to the treatement
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.character(treat), y = hhead_educ , color = as.character(treat))) +
  xlab('treat') +
  labs(title = 'Years of Education boxplot') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) #putting the title in the middle
#Boxplot for Forest area
forestareaplot <- ggplot(data = data) + # boxplot showing the age distribution according to the treatement
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.character(treat), y = forest_area , color = as.character(treat))) +
  xlab('treat') +
  labs(title = 'Forest area boxplot') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) #putting the title in the middle
#Boxplot for Base Tree cover in village
basetreecoverplot <- ggplot(data = data) + # boxplot showing the age distribution according to the treatement
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.character(treat), y = base_fcover_vil , color = as.character(treat))) +
  xlab('treat') +
  labs(title = 'Base Tree cover in village boxplot') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) #putting the title in the middle

plot_grid(ageplot, educationplot, forestareaplot, basetreecoverplot) #put the graphics side by side 
```
With the boxes, we can see that the two groups are quite similar. Indeed, the medians and quartiles are similar for the age, the years of education. For the area of basic forest in the villages, the outliers for the control group are clearly visible, pulling the group average upwards.  

## Distribution

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

educationdistribution <- ggplot(data = data) + # plot showing the age distribution according to the treatement
  geom_density(aes(x = hhead_educ, color = treat)) +
  labs(title = 'Years of Education distribution') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
agedistribution <- ggplot(data = data) + # plot showing the age distribution according to the treatement
  geom_density(aes(x = hhead_age, color = treat)) +
  labs(title = 'Age distribution') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

plot_grid(educationdistribution, agedistribution) 
```
The curves look the same, the two groups are very similar. It is difficult to read the other variables which are indicator variables, the curves are quite unreadable.

# VI. Randomization Inference

Our sharp null hypothesis states that the programme did not increase the area of forest.

To test this sharp null hypothesis, we take as a test statistic the difference in the average vegetation change between the treatment and control groups : 

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
#calculation of the difference and recording in the object "observed_difference"
observed_difference <- mean(data$change_fcover_vil[data$treat == 'Control'], na.rm = TRUE) - mean(data$change_fcover_vil[data$treat == 'Treatment'], na.rm = TRUE)
observed_difference
```
The observed difference is negative. Thus the change in forest area is greater for the treatment group than for the control group on average. 

We then create the distribution of this test statistic under the sharp null hypothesis by running simulations. 
```{r, eval = TRUE}
# we build the vector to record the results
simulated_difference <- rep(NA, 1000)
# we make the loop
for (i in 1:1000){
# we switch the treatment
data <- data %>%
  mutate(new_treat = sample(treat, replace = FALSE))
# we store the result
simulated_difference[i] <- mean(data$change_fcover_vil[data$new_treat== 'Control'], na.rm = TRUE)-mean(data$change_fcover_vil[data$new_treat== 'Treatment'], na.rm = TRUE)
}
```

Once the simulations are done, we plot the distribution of the test statistic under the sharp null hypothesis and add the mean of the simulations and the observed effect. 
```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# we build the data table
data_simulations <- tibble(simulated_difference = simulated_difference)
graphe <- ggplot(data_simulations, aes(x = simulated_difference)) +
  # we plot the density curve in blue
  geom_density(color = "black", fill = "deepskyblue3", alpha = 0.5) +
  #we plot the average of the 1000 random distributions in black
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(data_simulations$simulated_difference), color = "black") +
  #we plot the observed difference in red
  geom_vline(xintercept = -5.1559 , color = "coral") +
  theme_minimal()

print(graphe)
graphe
```
The sharp null hypothesis can be rejected visually. Indeed, the observed effect is far from the test statistic result under the null hypothesis.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# calculation of the one-sided p-value
(sum(simulated_difference <= observed_difference)/1000)*100

# calculation of the two-sided p-value
(sum(abs(simulated_difference) <= observed_difference)/1000)*100
```
The one-sided and two-sided p-values confirm that the sharp null hypothesis can be rejected. Indeed, here the probability of making an error by rejecting the sharp null hypothesis is zero. 
It can be concluded that the programme does have an effect on participants' income.

# VII. Neyman approach

Let's calculate the 95% confidence interval using the Neyman formula. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
#calculation of the first term
first_term <- var(data$change_fcover_vil[data$treat== 'Control'], na.rm = TRUE)
#calculation of the second term
second_term <- var(data$change_fcover_vil[data$treat== 'Treatment'], na.rm = TRUE)
#calculation of the standard error
se <- sqrt(first_term + second_term)
#calculation of the 95% confidence interval
#calculation of the lower bound
lower_bound <- observed_difference - 1.96*se
#calculation of the upper bound 
upper_bound <- observed_difference + 1.96*se
lower_bound
upper_bound
```
We are 95% confident that the effect of the programme would be between these two values. The confidence interval is wide (width = 97,488) and there is a negative and a positive bound. The uncertainty around the treatment effect does not mean that the programme necessarily has a positive effect on forests.We are 95% sure that the effect of the programme can be negative or positive. 

# VIII. Linear regression approach

## Calculation of ITTd
```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
lm(Ftakeup ~ treat, data = data)  
```
So ITTd = 0.3098. The effect of village allocation to treatment on programme participation is around 0,31. This means that there are about 31% of compliers (those in villages allocated to the treatment group who participate in the programme).

## Calculation of ITT

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
lm(change_fcover_vil ~ treat, data = data)
```
Si ITT = 5.156. The effect of allocating villages to the treatment group (regardless of whether PFOs participate in the programme or not) is around 5.16. Allocation to treatment increased the area of forest in the village by 5 percentage points.

## Calculation of CACE 
```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ivreg(change_fcover_vil ~ Ftakeup | treat, data = data)
```
So CACE = 16.64. The causal effect for the compliers on the area of forest in the village is around 16.64. 

## Reproduction of table 2 

Now we will reproduce "table 2 : Program enrollment, compliance, and payments" of the researchers' paper by linear regressions. 
All columns include the village-level effects of the four variables to balance the randomisation: the number of PFOs in the base sample, the average weekly wage per capita, the distance to the nearest main road and the average size of the declared plot closest to the dwelling. 


```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
#we put our treatment variable back as an indicator to facilitate the linear regressions 
data <- data %>%
  mutate(treat = ifelse(treat == 'Treatment', 1, 0))
```


### First column
```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# Ftakeup (programme participation) is regressed on the treatment allocation taking into account the control variables
lm(Ftakeup ~ treat + num_PFOs_vil + inc_pc_vil + dist_road_vil + l1_area_vil, data = data) %>%
  broom::tidy(., conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "treat") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:conf.high), ~ round(., 2)) %>%
  rename("Term" = term, "Estimate" = estimate, "Lower Bound 95% CI" = conf.low, "Upper Bound 95% CI" = conf.high) %>%

  kable(., align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```
Here we find approximately the ITTd already calculated. 

### Second column 
```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# Conserved (enrolled and deemed to have conserve forest ) is regressed on the treatment allocation taking into account the control variables
lm(conserved ~ treat + num_PFOs_vil + inc_pc_vil + dist_road_vil + l1_area_vil, data = data) %>%
  broom::tidy(., conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "treat") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:conf.high), ~ round(., 2)) %>%
  rename("Term" = term, "Estimate" = estimate, "Lower Bound 95% CI" = conf.low, "Upper Bound 95% CI" = conf.high) %>%

  kable(., align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```
The treatment therefore had a positive effect (O.28) on the forests as it did encourage the PFOs to conserve their forests. The number of PFOs enrolled and deemd to have conserve forest has increased. 

### Third column 
```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# Pay_cons (amount paid for avoided deforestation) is regressed on the treatment allocation taking into account the control variables
lm(pay_cons ~ treat + num_PFOs_vil + inc_pc_vil + dist_road_vil + l1_area_vil, data = data) %>%
  broom::tidy(., conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "treat") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:conf.high), ~ round(., 2)) %>%
  rename("Term" = term, "Estimate" = estimate, "Lower Bound 95% CI" = conf.low, "Upper Bound 95% CI" = conf.high) %>%

  kable(., align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```
The treatment allowance necessarily has an effect on the income paid by the programme for PFOs to preserve their forest because if villages are allocated to treatment, PFOs will join the programme and receive money. 

### 4th column 
```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
# Fperc_paid (proportion of eligible amount paid) is regressed on the treatment allocation taking into account the control variables
lm(Fperc_paid ~ treat + num_PFOs_vil + inc_pc_vil + dist_road_vil + l1_area_vil, data = data) %>%
  broom::tidy(., conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "treat") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:conf.high), ~ round(., 2)) %>%
  rename("Term" = term, "Estimate" = estimate, "Lower Bound 95% CI" = conf.low, "Upper Bound 95% CI" = conf.high) %>%

  kable(., align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

## Reproduction of table 3 

We will now reproduce the first two columns of "table 3 : Effect of the PES program on tree cover". We include the same covariates as in Table 2. 

### First column

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
data %>%
  select(village, treat, change_fcover_vil, num_PFOs_vil,
         inc_pc_vil,dist_road_vil, l1_area_vil) %>%
  group_by(village, treat) %>%
  summarise_all(~ mean(., na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  # change_fcover_vil (change in forest area with the programme) is regressed on the treatment allocation taking into account the control variables
  lm(change_fcover_vil ~ treat + num_PFOs_vil + inc_pc_vil + dist_road_vil + l1_area_vil, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy(., conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "treat") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:conf.high), ~ round(., 2)) %>%
  rename("Term" = term, "Estimate" = estimate, "Lower Bound 95% CI" = conf.low, "Upper Bound 95% CI" = conf.high) %>%
  kable(., align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```
Here we have approximately the ITT already calculated.The control variables added to this table change the result a little. It is therefore the same interpretation as for the ITT

### Second column 

Here this is the same regression but with two new control variables : photo1991_vil and photo2011_vil. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE}
data %>%
  select(village, treat, change_fcover_vil, num_PFOs_vil,
         inc_pc_vil,dist_road_vil, l1_area_vil, photo1991_vil, photo2011_vil) %>%
  group_by(village, treat) %>%
  summarise_all(~ mean(., na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  lm(change_fcover_vil ~ treat + num_PFOs_vil + inc_pc_vil + dist_road_vil + l1_area_vil + photo1991_vil + photo2011_vil, data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy(., conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "treat") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:conf.high), ~ round(., 2)) %>%
  rename("Term" = term, "Estimate" = estimate, "Lower Bound 95% CI" = conf.low, "Upper Bound 95% CI" = conf.high) %>%
  kable(., align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```
The added control variable lowers the effect of the treatment allowance somewhat. 

# IX. Robustness analyses


Here we will look at whether the outcomes change much if we add control variables 

Let us look at the change in the effect of treatment allocation on outcome when adding control variables to the linear regression. 
We have seen that the ITT gives 5.156. This is the linear regression of the outcome on the treatment allocation. In column 1 of table 3, we have the same regression with the addition of 4 control variables. This regression gives us an effect of 5.54. So the difference between the two is small (0.38). However, when we add two more variables in column 2 of table 3, we have a quite big difference with the ITT: 0.67. If these variables are not controlled, the outcome changes. So it's not very robust. 


# Conclusion 

Cash for Carbon is part of a type of environmental program called PES: Payments for Ecosystem Services. Seema Jayachandran's experiment is not innovative in the sense that similar experiments had already been set up in Mexico and Costa Rica. Nevertheless, Cash for Carbon has the particularity of being a randomized experiment which allows for a more realistic result. The researchers' results were quite encouraging in that the experiment showed a decrease in tree cover that was twice as great in the untreated PFOs. After replicating the experiment and testing the sharp null hypothesis, we know that the experiment does have a real impact on deforestation. Moreover, our results are consistent with those of the researchers: the treatment did increase the forest area by about 5 hectares per village, and when we test the robustness of the experiment, we notice that the addition of new variables only slightly modifies the results.
Nevertheless, the confidence interval measured by Neyman's approach shows us that the interval in which the result lies at 95% has a negative bound. The data suggests that this experiment could have resulted in even higher deforestation among the treated OFPs. 
One of the reasons why this experiment was successful is that leakage is better treated than in most PFOs. For example, if PFOs commit to conserving their forests, members of the treatment group can make financial agreements with members of the control group to cut twice as many trees in exchange for sharing in the program funding.
Thus, the Cash for Carbon experiment is a success, insofar as it demonstrates that previous PSE have misjudged the usefulness of a financing program for environmental protection.
